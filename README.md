## about us

@ targimo, we're passionate about pushing the boundaries of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in the Arabic language. Our journey began with a shared vision: to bridge the gap between cutting-edge NLP research and the rich, diverse linguistic tapestry of the Arab world. Founded by a dedicated team of data scientists, our mission is to explore, adapt, and innovate in the realm of NLP to unlock the immense potential of Arabic text. We're not just developing solutions; we're crafting a story of technological transformation. With limited resources but limitless determination, we're committed to providing accessible, high-quality research and tools to meet the growing demand for NLP solutions in the Arabic-speaking regions. Our journey is fueled by curiosity, collaboration, and the belief that every line of code we write contributes to making the digital world more inclusive and connected.
